Elevator pitch: Lots of tabletop games, like Dungeons and Dragons, require dice rolling. Recently, many online platforms allow for digital dice rolling for those who don't have dice. However, in order to prevent the egregious crime that is dishonesty in games, I propose a service which allows a player to roll one or more dice digitally, simultaneously displaying the result to another device, keeping both players on the same page of what the result actually is. Fund me?
