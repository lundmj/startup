Matthew Lund's repository for CS260 @ BYU

Elevator pitch: Lots of tabletop games, like Dungeons and Dragons, require dice rolling. Recently, many online platforms allow for digital dice rolling for those who don't have dice. However, in order to prevent the egregious crime that is dishonesty in games, I propose a service which allows a player to roll one or more dice digitally, simultaneously displaying the result to another device, keeping both players on the same page of what the result actually is. Fund me?

(Sketch in repository)

Key Features:
- Ability to choose what kind of dice to roll
- Ability to choose how many dice to roll
- Ability to apply a "modifier," or a value that gets added to whatever result is rolled
- Instantly displays the roll for the roller and the one who they connect with, which is probably the person administering the game
- Rolls up to 8 dice at once, both displaying their values and providing a sum at the bottom

NOTES FOR SIMON
HTML:
It was way easier than I expected! I tried to basically go through each thing and code it as it was written in the example thing. Some things I did a tiny bit different. For the actual buttons in play.html, I did copy what was there, but I looked through to try and understand what it was saying. But yeah I got some more experience putting together html, and got to see the process of turning my html from VSCode into an actual subdomain in my website!

NOTES FOR STARTUP
HTML and CSS:
Messing around with CSS helps you to learn a lot about how it goes together. I am by no means a pro at it yet, but I was able to figure out how to make my application work well, mostly within a mobile phone's dimensions. Currently it uses some crappy dice png files, but once I learn how to implement my dice rolling into the project, I will make these fit into the site better. They are currently more of a placeholder for that feature.
JAVASCRIPT:
Lots of stuff in JavaScript was new to me because it was hard to understand right away from class and homework. I tried to better understand things like eventListeners, etc.
