Elevator pitch: Lots of tabletop games, like Dungeons and Dragons, require dice rolling. Recently, many online platforms allow for digital dice rolling for those who don't have dice. However, in order to prevent the egregious crime that is dishonesty in games, I propose a service which allows a player to roll one or more dice digitally, simultaneously displaying the result to another device, keeping both players on the same page of what the result actually is. Fund me?

(Sketch in repository)

Key Features:
- Ability to choose what kind of dice to roll
- Ability to choose how many dice to roll
- Ability to apply a "modifier," or a value that gets added to whatever result is rolled
- Instantly displays the roll for the roller and the one who they connect with, which is probably the person administering the game
- Rolls up to 8 dice at once, both displaying their values and providing a sum at the bottom
